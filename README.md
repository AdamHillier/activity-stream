# Activity Stream

This is the source code for the Activity Stream project, which replaces the "New Tab" of Firefox with a new design based on rich metadata and browsing behavior.

We export our code to Mozilla Central on a weekly (or sometimes more frequent) basis.

## Where should I file bugs?

Although we regularly check the ActivityStream:NewTab component on Bugzilla, we generally
like to file bugs at https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/issues.

## For Developers

If you are interested in contributing, take a look at [this guide](contributing.md) on where to find us and how to contribute,
and [this guide](docs/v2-system-addon/1.GETTING_STARTED.md) for getting your development environment set up.

## For Localizers

Activity Stream localization is managed via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/activity-stream-new-tab/), not direct pull requests to the repository. If you want to fix a typo, add a new language, or simply know more about localization, please get in touch with the [existing localization team](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/teams/) for your language, or Mozillaâ€™s [l10n-drivers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mozilla_Team#Mozilla_Corporation) for guidance.
